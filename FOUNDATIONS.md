# Observatory Foundations

## Foundational assumptions

- The repository owns one bounded concern and integrates through explicit contracts.
- Human authority, privacy, safety, provenance, and accessibility are architectural constraints.
- Canonical source is distinguishable from generated output and transient state.
- Observed, desired, proposed, and accepted states remain distinguishable.
- Validation evidence must be reproducible closely enough to support review.
- Standalone usefulness is preserved even when the wider organization adds value.
- Self-hosting and portability are supported without pretending external compute, storage, domains, or providers are free.

## Enduring constraints

- Do not make mutable default branches or unpublished internal APIs cross-repository dependencies.
- Do not put secrets, private source material, or provider credentials in generated architecture or distribution artifacts.
- Do not let convenience erase approval, rollback, or provenance at consequential boundaries.
- Do not claim cross-platform, self-hosted, or production support beyond verified evidence.

## Trust boundaries

Repository source, generated artifacts, local state, external providers, organization automation, and user-controlled infrastructure are distinct trust zones. Every crossing requires an explicit data, authority, and failure contract.

## Success properties

The foundation is healthy when Evidence ingestion, Health and maturity model, Organization landscape, Actionable reporting remain independently testable and their ownership is clear.

## Evidence and uncertainty

- **Observed:** The repository README establishes the intended boundary as the organization-wide visibility, maturity, health, and platform-observability system; significant implementation remains incomplete.
- **Decided for this draft:** The repository owns the bounded concern described here and participates through versioned contracts.
- **Proposed:** Target systems and later roadmap phases remain proposals until accepted and implemented.
- **Open question:** Which parts of this draft should become active in the first independently versioned release?
